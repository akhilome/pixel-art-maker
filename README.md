# Pixel Art Maker Udacity Project [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://akhilome.github.io/pixel-art-maker)

This is the final project for the ALC (Andela Learning Community) with Google 3.0
challenge scholarship.

With this project, we are required to build a single page web app which demonstrates 
the following skills learnt: 

* HTML,
* CSS,
* Foundational Javascript,
* DOM Interaction and manipulation with jQuery.

The _app_ can be used to create flags like this:

Or, hell, _smileys_ like this:

**Plus** it's also mobile responsive:

Go, break some eggs.
